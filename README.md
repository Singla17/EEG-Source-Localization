# EEG Source Localization using Deep Learning Techniques
We have simulated a dataset of EEG signals using MATLAB, getting real data is very difficult for this problem as ground truth is unknown in real data. You can find all our implementations in "implementation.ipynb" and we have also attached a [report](https://github.com/Singla17/ELL319_Term_Project/blob/main/Report.pdf) of our work.
